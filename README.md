# cs132finalprj

Our design was created knowing that our users will be in the age range of 13-17. We wanted to design something that was interactive
and would sustain a user's attenion span for 10-12 minutes. In addition to the overall concept of our UI, we wanted our page flow
to be direct and clearly layout each step of the game. The pages included are a start page, a user info page, instrucitons page, 
and the game page. The game page includes popups (using modals) for results of the round (win or lose), user options at the end of each rouch
(keep token, convert token to points, and deduct points), sending a message to the opponent, and insturctions. Since our backend is not included,
the chatroom is only limited to messages from the user and not the opponent. We hardcoded the user and opponent info just as place holders. When
the backend is implemented, this will be updated after each round.

Known Bugs

We have a few bugs in the functionality of our code. The "Hit Sparbar" banner does not appear for the same amount of time each round.
Our animaiton doesn't always work during each round as well. In terms of bugs with our design, the positions of the cars don't adjust 
to be inline with the tracks. The size of our page will not change during the user experience. However, we will make sure to fix this
before our final handin.
